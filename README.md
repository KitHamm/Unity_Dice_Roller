# Unity Dice Roller

Hello!

I decided to I wanted to make something in Unity to practice my skills. As a fan of table top games, Dungeons and Dragons especially, I decided to make a dice rolling companion to help with gameplay. 

## Features

With this project you can choose up to 8 dice to roll from a 4 sided die to a 10 sided die. You can mix and match the rolling die, so you can have 1 of each, all the same or any combination. 

The randomness of the rolls is controlled by the physics engine in 3d. When you add a die, a random rotation is added to the prefab as it is placed in its holding position. When you roll the dice a force is added to make it land inside the tray, with a random amount of spin added on all axis.

Cocked die don't count. If a die that is rolled is mostly flat on one of its faces you will have to reroll the die. The same happened if a die lands on top of another die - you will re roll the die in top. 

You can choose to show just the total number rolled, or also view the highest roll and the lowest roll. 

This project uses the Cinemachine cameras for Unity, seamlessly transitioning when the Dice are rolled, and focusing on the result when all the Dice have settled. 

 ## Assets

 I have used a free 3d asset from  [Collection Dice set for role-playing games](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/collection-dice-set-for-role-playing-games-202821) by [Armor and Rum](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/55245) with some of my own modifications made in blender. These modification include adding physical recesses to the die for the numbers and added a separate material slot. The idea of this is to be able to make funky custom skins for the dice. For the environment I have also used some assets from [Furniture FREE Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/furniture-free-pack-192628) by [DEXSOFT](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/15).

 ## Todo

 There are still some features that I would like to improve or add.

 - Continue modeling the 3D Dice.
 - New Dice Skins.
 - Enhance environment.
 - Mobile Optimization.
